# The Oddcast Avatar Module
This module makes surveys more interactive by adding an "avatar" character to the page that can read messages to the participant at specific times.  It was developed for and is specifically tailored to the needs of the STRIDE grant.  Some features include:

* **Page Messages** - Have the avatar read messages to the user when certain pages are loaded
* **Message for field values** - Have the avatar read messages to the user when certain values are selected
* **Review Mode** - Step through the pages of a survey for review/demonstration purposes while skipping required fields before actually beginning the survey
* **Survey Timeout** - Restart the survey after a certain amount of time is elapsed to protect sensitive data if users walk away from the screen
